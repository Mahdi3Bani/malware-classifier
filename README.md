## Introduction

Malware classification is a critical task in cybersecurity, aimed at identifying and categorizing malware into its respective families. This project explores different neural network architectures and transformer models to improve the accuracy and efficiency of malware detection.

## Features

- Implementation of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequential data analysis.
- Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network combined with LSTM (CNN-LSTM) for enhanced feature extraction and sequence modeling.
- Use of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for contextual text understanding and CANINE (Character-Aware Neural Information Extraction) for handling character-level inputs.

## Models
# LSTM

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning long-term dependencies. They are well-suited for sequential data and can capture patterns over time.
# CNN-LSTM

A combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and LSTM networks. CNNs are used for feature extraction from input data, which are then fed into LSTMs to model the sequential dependencies.
# BERT and Cnine

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based model designed for natural language understanding tasks. It captures contextual relationships between words in a text.


CANINE (Character-Aware Neural Information Extraction) processes text at the character level, allowing the model to handle rare and unseen words more effectively than traditional token-based approaches.
